# 🔥 UrbanCart – Customer Support Process Improvement Case Study  
### **“How Can We Scam an E-Commerce Company”**

---

## 🚨 The Hook  
Let’s be honest:  
If an e-commerce support system is weak, customers don’t need hacking skills -  
**the system practically scams itself.**

Here are some *uncomfortably common* exploitation scenarios that ANY retailer with messy workflows is vulnerable to:

- “Claiming” refunds without proof  
- “Reporting” missing items that actually arrived safely  
- “Escalating” fake issues with Oscar-level confidence  
- “Reopening” tickets until freebies appear like magic  
- “Spamming” duplicate tickets hoping one agent gives up  
- “Mislabeling” issues as urgent to skip the queue  
- “Taking advantage” of slow email-based escalations  

These aren’t high-tech scams.  
These are **basic human behavior + a broken support process**.

And that’s exactly the chaos I investigated.

# 🎯 Project Overview  
This case study analyzes and redesigns the customer support workflow at **UrbanCart**, a fictional e-commerce retailer known for great deals and… slightly less great processes.

The goal:  
To transform a slow, manual, loophole-filled support system into a **fast, fair, fraud-resistant, SLA-driven machine** using Business Analysis and Process Optimization.

This project showcases my skills in:

- Business process mapping  
- Root-cause analysis  
- Process redesign  
- Cross-functional flow analysis  
- KPI design  
- Dashboard wireframing  
- Consulting-style storytelling (with personality)

# 🧩 As-Is Findings (AKA “Where Things Fall Apart”)  
The current workflow suffers from:

- Manual categorisation (agents doing the system’s job)  
- Missing info loops (“Please share your order ID…” forever)  
- Email-based escalations that disappear into a black hole  
- No SLA or priority model (everything is urgent—meaning nothing is)  
- No dashboards (managers relying on hope + refreshing inboxes)  
- Inconsistent agent responses  
- Fraud vulnerabilities wide enough to drive a truck through

# 🔍 Pain Points & Root Causes  
A combination of:

- Automation gaps  
- Weak intake validation  
- No routing rules  
- External teams working outside the CRM  
- Manual decision-making  
- Zero real-time visibility  

Basically:  
**the system was on paid leave while agents did all the work.**

# 🚀 To-Be Process (The “Finally, It Makes Sense” Version)  
The redesigned workflow introduces:

- Structured ticket intake with mandatory fields  
- Automated categorisation & routing  
- SLA-based prioritisation  
- In-CRM escalations (goodbye email black hole)  
- Standardised templates & knowledge base  
- Real-time dashboards for leads  
- Automated CSAT feedback loop

# 📊 KPI Framework & Performance Metrix  
To track performance like a real consulting team, I designed KPIs for:

- Avg Resolution Time  
- First Response Time  
- SLA Compliance  
- First-Time Resolution  
- CSAT  
- Reopen Rate  
- Category trends  
- Agent workload  

---

# 🛠 Recommendations (High-Impact + Realistic)  
1. Enforce mandatory fields  
2. Automate routing & categorisation  
3. Introduce SLA-based priority  
4. Move escalations fully into CRM  
5. Standardise agent responses  
6. Provide real-time SLA dashboards  
7. Implement automated CSAT surveys  

Together, they build a **fraud-resistant, faster, scalable support system.**

# 🌟 Why This Project Matters  
Customer support isn’t just about solving problems.  
It’s about:

- preventing misuse  
- protecting revenue  
- reducing manual load  
- improving customer trust  
- supporting scalable growth  

This case study shows how structured BA thinking can turn chaos into clarity —  
with a process that is **fast, fair, fraud-resistant, and customer-friendly**.
